## Title: Driving Sustainable Development in Spanish Municipalities: The Circular City Index as an Open Data Tool for Policymakers in Spain

_What is the level of preparedness of Spanish municipalities towards urban circularity and green transition, according to the Circular City Index, and how do socio-demographic and economic characteristics impact this level of preparedness?_

## About the thesis

This study represents an important contribution to the emerging field of circular economies by modifying and testing a universal set of strategies for quantifying and evaluating sustainable development challenges at the municipal level. This development is important given the growing necessity for a more comprehensive and universal approach for quantifying and evaluating sustainable development challenges at the municipal level. The modified Circular City Index methodology in combination with the non-spatial and spatial models developed in this study will provide a tool for policymakers to in-depth understand local contexts, identify areas of improvement and align their policies with European targets, as the index incorporates aspects of the European Unionâ€™s Green Deal. The transparency, reproducibility and scalability of the results will ensure that all stakeholders can benefit from this open data approach, leading to more effective and sustainable solutions to local challenges.

## Conclusion

In this thesis, a reformulated and redefined version of the Circularity City Index (CCI) is presented that contributes to the growing necessity for a more comprehensive and universal approach to quantify and assess circular economies. The modified index was tested in a case study of 8,217 municipalities in Spain to evaluate their preparedness towards urban circularity and green transition. As the index centers on open data principles, the thesis is fully reproducible, scalable, and built on open source data, methodologies, and software.

This study highlights the importance of adapting the CCI methodology to fit local contexts in order to ensure its effectiveness. The study developed a reliable spatial model that explained the relationships between the preparedness of municipalities and local socio-demographic and economic characteristics. The findings reveal that population size is the primary socio-demographic characteristic that impacts urban circularity, with larger populated municipalities generally being more prepared for green transition than smaller ones.

The study findings provide a foundation for future research on this topic. When taking into consideration socio-demographic and economic characteristics, the index is a valuable tool for policymakers to identify challenges, and to develop sustainable policies at the municipal level. The results of this study can therefore be applied to wider contexts, and support the transition towards more sustainable and circular urban systems.
